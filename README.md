# TwoPhoton-OpticsSuite
A collection of Python-based tools for two-photon in vivo fluorescence imaging and optical system design in biophotonics research. Includes interactive GUIs for ray tracing, galvo scanner alignment, lens configuration optimization, and fluorescence signal analysis. Designed for use in advanced retinal imaging and optical alignment studies.
# Ray Trace GUI â€” Galvo + L1 + L2 + L2'

An **interactive optical ray tracing tool** built in Python using **PyQt5** and **Matplotlib**, designed for modeling **galvo-based scanning systems** in **two-photon in vivo fluorescence imaging** setups.

---

## Features
- Adjustable **galvo scan angle** and **semi-aperture**.
- Configurable **focal lengths** and **positions** for L1, L2, and L2'.
- **Afocal telescope mode** with one-click configuration.
- **Central-ray image plane** visualization.
- Export **ray path data to CSV** for analysis.
- Save **publication-quality plots** (Times New Roman font).
